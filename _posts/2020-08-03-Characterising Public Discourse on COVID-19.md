In this project, I worked to conduct analysis on time series data from news, blogs, and discussions of discourse on COVID with [Professor Ágnes Horvát](http://www.agneshorvat.info/) and [Henry Dambanemuya](https://www.dambanemuya.com/) at Northwestern University. This project is still ongoing and will be updated once completed.
