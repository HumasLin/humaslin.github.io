In this project, I worked to conduct analysis on time series data from news, blogs, and discussions of discourse on COVID with [Professor Ágnes Horvát](http://www.agneshorvat.info/) and [Henry Dambanemuya](https://www.dambanemuya.com/) at [LINK (Lab on Innovation, Networks, and Knowledge)](https://link.soc.northwestern.edu) of Northwestern University. The main discovery we made was on the dynamics across different platforms and under different topics.

In this research project my duty mostly covered:

- Use Tableau and plotting libraries in Python to make creative visualizations demonstrating temporal variation in the coverage amounts and the sentiment scores.
- Run statistical analysis to see whether linguistic features vary across platforms, and whether one platform is leading another one in covering certain topics. 
- Drawing conclusions with statistical validation or adequate supporting data.

We found the media on different platforms hold disparate linguistic features. The timing to cover certain topics is also very different. The analysis on these topics spans from ANOVA tests, HSD Tukey tests, to correlation scores calculation. The findings in our research were sythesized in a paper and published to [JQD:DM](https://humaslin.github.io/img/jqd_014.pdf). The source codes are included in the [repository of LINK](https://github.com/LINK-NU/JQD-DM-COVID-19)
