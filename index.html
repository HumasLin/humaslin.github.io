 <ul class="post-list">
 <p>Hi there!</p>

 <p>I'm Haomin Lin, a graduate student studying <a href="https://cse.gatech.edu">Computational Science and Engineering</a> at Georgia Institute of Technology. I hold strong interest in research in computational social science and social network analysis. My research goal is to discover the how information is spread and processed among people, and how the update of subjective belief happens in information diffusion.</p>

 <p>This summer, I worked with <a href="https://www.xiaojingliao.com">Professor Liao</a> at Indiana University to assist text processing. After this, I’m lucky to have a chance to join <a href="http://www.agneshorvat.info">Professor Horvat</a> at Northwestern University to study Public Discourse on COVID-19.</p>

 <p>Prior to entering Georgia Tech, I studied Optical Engineering at Tianjin University and Nankai University. During that time, I benefited from various research experiences at Nankai University, Huaqiao University, and Purdue University. I also worked at HC SemiTek corporation to explore customer behavior with data science. After coming to Georgia Tech, I’ve done several projects with attempts to combine data science with social science topics. </p>
