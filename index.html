 <p>Hi Dear Visitor!</p>

 <p>I'm Haomin Lin, a student and Data Science Research Assistant in the MS <span style="color: #4267B2;"><a href="https://cse.gatech.edu">Computational Science and Engineering</a></span> program at Georgia Institute of Technology. I have strong interest in implementing data science techniques to conduct insightful analysis on large-scale data. Specifically, I hold strong ambition in discovering stories under text-based social media data, which may reveal the patterns of information spreading and how they are processed by people. And I'm also proficient in building up machine learning models that assist information extraction.</p>

 <p>In the summer of 2020, I worked with <span style="color: #4267B2;"><a href="https://www.xiaojingliao.com">Professor Xiaojing Liao</a></span> at Indiana University to assist text processing, <span style="color: #4267B2;"><a href="https://humaslin.github.io/2020/07/06/Information-Extraction-on-Advisory-Reports.html">extracting key information from unstructured text data online</a></span>. After this, I joined <span style="color: #4267B2;"><a href="http://www.agneshorvat.info">Professor Agnes Horvat</a></span> at Northwestern University to study <span style="color: #4267B2;"><a href="https://humaslin.github.io/2020/09/16/Characterising-Public-Discourse-on-COVID-19.html">Public Discourse on COVID-19</a></span>, where we found a significant leading position for news compared with discussions when covering certain topics, which has been publised on <span style="color: #4267B2;"><a href="https://humaslin.github.io/img/jqd_014.pdf">Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media</a></span>.</p>

 <p>At Georgia Tech, I work with <span style="color: #4267B2;"><a href="http://www.munmund.net/">Professor Munmun De Choudhury</a></span> to study how immigrants are portrayed in the media. I also led data analytics projects in several courses to explore in the fields of Computational Social Science, including <span style="color: #4267B2;"><a href="https://humaslin.github.io/2020/05/02/Revealing-Gendered-Language-in-Job-Descriptions.html">investigating gender language usage in job postings</a></span>, exploring insights about social segregation, etc. Apart from research work, my experience further extends to developing some practical tools with Machine Learning algorithms. For example, Automatic Options Trading Generation that utilized Deep Reinforcement Learning framework to generate option trading decisions. With my knowledge in Big Data techniques and Deep Learning frameworks, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for graduate level course <span style="color: #4267B2;"><a href="http://www.sunlab.org/teaching/cse6250/spring2020/">CSE 6250 - Big Data Health</a></span>, where I share my knowledge with students to help them crack the course and build great projects.</p>
